# The Problem

## Five terms. Overlapping definitions. No clear decision guide.

---

You're building a repo. You want Copilot to "just know" your conventions.
You've heard about all of these:

| Term | What people *think* it means |
|------|------|
| **Prompt** | "The thing I type in chat" |
| **Instructions** | "Some markdown file… somewhere?" |
| **Prompt file** | "Wait, isn't that the same as instructions?" |
| **Skill** | "Like a plugin? Or a prompt? Or…?" |
| **Agent** | "Agent mode, right? The thing I'm already using?" |
| **Sub-agent** | "An agent… inside an agent?" |

### The real question

```
  You're about to add structure to your Copilot workflow.

  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                                                    │
  │   Should I put this in...                          │
  │                                                    │
  │     □ copilot-instructions.md ?                    │
  │     □ a .prompt.md file ?                          │
  │     □ a SKILL.md ?                                 │
  │     □ an .agent.md ?                               │
  │     □ just... type it in chat every time?          │
  │                                                    │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

By the end of this talk, you'll have a clear decision framework.
